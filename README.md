# CTFPrep-Onboarding-Platform

I attended a CTFPrep event hosted by APU FSEC-SS on 4th May 2024. It was amusing and I managed to finish all of the given challenges within the time.
It is totally for beginners and everyone. So I suggest you all trying out the challenges before viewing the solutions, you can check out the site here: http://54.83.103.84/ (Available for the day)

Update: The website is not hosting anymore. 
Another Update: Try this! http://3.93.199.122:8000/challenges
